# MineSafe-AI

**Predict Rockfall Before It Happens.**

MineSafe-AI is an advanced, AI-powered rockfall hazard prediction system designed specifically for Indian open-pit mines. It integrates geological, environmental, and operational data to assess risk in real-time, protecting miners with actionable, data-driven safety intelligence.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-Time Risk Predictor:** An interactive web tool that analyzes 14+ specific parameters (e.g., Slope Angle, Weathering Grade, Joint Friction) to instantly calculate a composite **Risk Score** and determine the overall **Hazard Level**.
- **YOLO Vision Detection:** A robust computer vision pipeline (powered by YOLOv8) to detect rockfall events in real-time from slope surveillance camera feeds.
- **Dynamic Analytics Dashboard:** Live visual tracking of risk distributions, feature importance (via correlation), regional data profiles, and model performance metrics, utilizing `Chart.js`.
- **Context-Aware Recommendations:** Automatically suggests safety and mitigation measures based on the specific hazard triggers detected (e.g., heavy rainfall or excessive vibrations).
- **Indian Mining Context:** Specialized profiles and risk analyses tailored to the varying topographies of Indian mining corridors including Jharkhand (Coal), Odisha (Iron Ore), and Rajasthan (Limestone).

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Premium Dark Theme, Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), Pandas, NumPy
- **Computer Vision:** Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV
